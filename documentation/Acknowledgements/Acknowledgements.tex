Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my advisor \href{mailto:stefan.keller@ost.ch}{Prof. Stefan Keller}
for assisting and motivating me throughout the whole journey of creating this thesis.
Without his guidance and persistence, this project would have been hardly possible.\\
\newline
Besides my advisor, I also want to thank \href{mailto:felix.reiniger@ost.ch}{Felix Reiniger} for helping me with testing the extensions between each release, making sure
that they are still working as expected and that the new features have been implemented correctly.\\
\newline
I also would also like to thank the \href{https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine-dev}{OpenRefine Development Community} for always being available for helping me with any questions/concerns that I had.\\
\newline
A special thanks also goes to all of the authors of the Java libraries that were used to complete this project. I would also like to thank the GitLab team for having such a useful and efficient application lifecycle tool for me to use. It provided me with a code repository, CI/CD pipelines features and generally a nice and user-friendly environment to have my extensions on.\\
\newline
Last but not least, I want to thank my family for always being there for me and for continuously encouraging me to be the best version of myself.

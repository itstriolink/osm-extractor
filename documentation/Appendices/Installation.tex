\chapter{Installation}
For installing the extension and including it in OpenRefine, you need to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Download the latest release of the extension from project releases as an archived folder (.zip or .tgz)
    \item Unzip the folder into OpenRefine's \mintinline{bash}{/extensions} folder
\end{itemize}
For more information on how to install extensions, visit OpenRefine's official documentation on
\href{https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#installing-extensions}{installing extensions}.
The extension can also be compiled manually if preferred.
To do so, you need to have the source code repository and also Maven Apache installed.
When the requirements are met, execute the two following commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \mintinline{bash}{mvn clean compile} - Compiles the project
    \item \mintinline{bash}{mvn assembly:single} - Assembles the project into the required directory structure for
     OpenRefine to be included in the \mintinline{bash}{/extensions} folder
\end{itemize}
